									<br>SEARCH Homeless Services pursues a mission of providing hope, creating opportunity, and transforming lives. SEARCH
									would like your creative ideas on how we can leverage technology to attract and manage a volunteer workforce that
									can operate in support of our mission. We know that there are a lot of tools out in the market, but most of them
									focus on the operational side of volunteerism and management of volunteers. We are looking to invert this paradigm
									and want our volunteers to become "ambassadors" of the SEARCH mission. We want to empower the self service functions
									and encourage them to engage their social network to really accelerate SEARCH's reach and social impact.</p>

									culture. We base our high standards of service on five basic principles. Every decision we make—from client matters
									to strategic positioning—is tested and measured against these principles.</p>
